    <li>In Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I are teaching a new course,
      Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340).<br>
      The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal
      prerequisites, and will cover a range of ethical, societal, and policy
      implications of computing and information.</li>
